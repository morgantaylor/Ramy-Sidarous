    	<h2>Artist Statement</h2>
        <p>The transformation between reality and unreality are what my photographs address.  Landscapes hold scenes that in my view resemble puzzle pieces that when combined together, are capable of forming an infinite amount of photographic creations. Some of the scenes that are created by my photographs donâ€™t actually exist in reality; this imagery is made through subconscious thinking about the endless connections that I am surrounded by, and joining photographs from different times and places.  Several of my photographic composites are presented in a three-dimensional manner, serving as a metaphor for the insertion and removal of the imaginary puzzle pieces that are used to create the artwork. The nature of the Southwest inspires ideas into my mind, and I work those ideas into the puzzles I make--the abstract result of my imagination. My work is not just about the beauty of the landscape, but the beauty of thoughts that result from it--the creativity of the human mind to take something naturally beautiful and turn it into something new and equally wonderful. So now I provide viewers with the puzzle of my mind made visible through the very source of my inspiration, earth.</p>
